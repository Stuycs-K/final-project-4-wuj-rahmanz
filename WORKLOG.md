Researched about Burp Intruder. Assuming payload is a wordlist, there are 4 different attack-types: 


* Sniper - places each payload into each payload position. Requests = length of payload * num of positions
* Battering Ram - Iterates through the payload, inputting the word for each position. Reqests = payload length
* Pitchfork - Different wordlists for each payload position. Requests depend on the payloads' lengths.
* Cluster Bomb - Similar to pitchfork. However, every possible combination of payloads is tested.
